										<h2 id="content"> Lab Inventory </h2>
										<p>UMass Chan Medical School August 2022-February 2023</p>
										<p>During my time as a Lab Inventory Intern at UMass Chan Medical School, I gained invaluable experiences that enhanced my understanding of various aspects of IT technology and its integration into laboratory operations. One of my primary responsibilities was working closely with core directors to ensure the currency of IT technology. This involved staying up-to-date with the latest advancements, researching new tools and software, and assessing their potential impact on laboratory inventory management. Additionally, I developed my programming skills by creating scripts to manipulate and validate data, streamlining processes and improving accuracy. I also had the opportunity to establish fiscal requirements and technical limitations for maintaining IT technology, considering budget constraints and technological capabilities. Overall, my internship provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the intersection between laboratory inventory management and IT technology, equipping me with the skills necessary to excel in this field.</p>

												<h3>Research lab assistant</h3>
												<p>University of Massachusetts, Lowell October 2018 - August 2021</p>
												<p>During my time as a Research Lab Assistant at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, I had the opportunity to gain valuable experience and develop essential skills. One of my primary responsibilities was processing quantitative data, which involved utilizing both Bash and Python scripts to analyze and interpret large datasets. Additionally, I worked extensively with Big Data Clusters, employing UNIX commands to manipulate and extract relevant information from complex datasets. Another crucial aspect of my role was filtering data and extracting targeted DNA sequences, which required precision and attention to detail. In addition to my technical tasks, I also took pride in supporting my colleagues by offering innovative solutions to problems that arose during our research projects. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to showcase my work by presenting our findings to groups of approximately 20 individuals, honing my communication and presentation skills. Overall, my experience as a Research Lab Assistant at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell provided me with a strong foundation in data processing, problem-solving, and effective communication within a research environment.</p>

												<h3>Magna odio tempus commodo</h3>
												<p>CENTER FOR ASTROPHYSICS, HARVARD & SMITHSONIAN CAMBRIDGE, MA June 2020 - August 2020</p>
												<p>During my time as a research fellow at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian, I had the incredible opportunity to delve into the captivating world of astrophysics and focus on researching the variability in star formation. This experience not only deepened my understanding of the subject but also allowed me to refine my Python skills and discover how to integrate them into the field of astrophysics. Through analyzing and interpreting data, I gained invaluable insights into the complex processes governing the birth and evolution of stars. Additionally, I had the privilege of sharing my findings and experiences by compiling them into an academic poster, which showcased my dedication, knowledge, and passion for advancing our understanding of the cosmos. This research fellowship at the prestigious Center for Astrophysics was an enlightening and rewarding experience.</p>
